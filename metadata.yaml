description: Oh, isn't it just splendid, Ruth? Don't you feel like singing and dancing?
  Come on, let's have a two-step! I'll whistle! "Alice! How can you be so - so boisterous?"
  expostulated the taller of two girls, who stood in the middle of their small and
  rather shabby parlor. "Boisterous! Weren't you going to say - rude?" laughingly
  asked the one who had first spoken. "Come, now, 'fess up! Weren't you?" and the
  shorter of the twain, a girl rather plump and pretty, with merry brown eyes, put
  her arm about the waist of her sister and endeavored to lead her through the maze
  of chairs in the whirl of a dance, whistling, meanwhile, a joyous strain from one
  of the latest Broadway successes. "Oh, Alice!" came in rather fretful tones. "I
  don't -" "You don't know what to make of me? That's it; isn't it, sister mine? Oh,
  I can read you like a book. But, Ruth, why aren't you jolly once in a while? Why
  always that 'maiden all forlorn' look on your face? Why that far-away, distant look
  in your eyes - 'Anne, Sister Anne, dost see anyone approaching?' Talk about Bluebeard!
  Come on, do one turn with me. I'm learning the one-step, you know, and it's lovely!
